            <h3>First festival 1999</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The very first amateur sculpture festival was staged in 1999, and was co-ordinated by Brendan Doyle
                of the
                Cockleshell Art Gallery. Brendan had first seen sandsculpture the previous year on holiday in italy,
                and
                noticed that the sand used was very similar to the sand on Duncannon Beach.

            <hr>
            <p>
                The gallery commissioned artists Daniel Doyle and Fergus Mulvaney to come and test the sand for
                suitability and to act as resident artists for the duration of the festival. Both artists were
                studying sculpture at D.I.T. at this time, and also members of the Irish Sand & Snow Sculpture
                collective.</p>

                Doyle and Mulvaney spent four days on the beach working on their centrepiece of work and

                teaching and advising interested competitors on how to work with sand.<br>

            <p>
                This aspect of the festival can be categorised as a "performance Art", as not only is a sculpture
                being exhibited, but the public can see how the sculpture is being made whilst also getting involved
                themselves.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>
                Doyle and Mulvaney piece was called "Shipwreck" which featured a sailor clinging to a ships mast,
                hauling another another out of the sea.
                It measures approx. 6ft in height, with base measurements of 10ft x 15ft</p>

            <hr>
            <p>
                The "Shipwreck" piece was originally 8ft in height, but had been vandalised on the first night of
                the festival.
                This action prompted all future exhibition pieces in subsequent festivals to be enclosed in a
                tent.

            <hr>
            <p>First place in the Amateur Competition this first year went to Danny Brennan, a local artist, with
                his sculpture of the celtic god of the sea, "Manannan Mac Lir".

                It featured the head and hand of the god, gasping for air as he rises from the sea.
                His piece was finished minutes before the deadline, which was when the tide would come in.
                Brennan had never made a sandsculpture before.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Following the successful first year, Cockleshell Gallery discovered at this time that Ireland was one
                of the few European countries without a national sandsculpting competition. They began to pursue the 
                task of hosting an international Competition which would be Ireland's first Open Sand Sculpture 
                Championship, as part of the nationwide Year 2000 Millenium Celebration SArts Program.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>The theme for 2000 was "Sea-Tales". The new artists involved were Neils "Edwin" Vegter from Holland,
                Caroline
                Saint-Olive from France, Nuria Villaginis from Spain and Sissa Yorgensen from Denmark. Other artists
                such as
                Niall Magee and Alan Magee have since joined this group.
