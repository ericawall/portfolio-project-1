                <hr>
                <p>The very first amateur sculpture festival was staged in 1999, and was co-ordinated by Brendan Doyle
                    of the
                    Cockleshell Art Gallery. Brendan had first seen sandsculpture the previous year on holiday in italy,
                    and
                    noticed that the sand used was very similar to the sand on Duncannon Beach.

                <p>
                    The gallery commissioned artists Daniel Doyle and Fergus Mulvaney to come and test the sand for
                    suitability and to act as resident artists for the duration of the festival. Both artists were
                    studying sculpture at D.I.T. at this time, and also members of the Irish Sand & Snow Sculpture
                    collective.</p>

                    Doyle and Mulvaney spent four days on the beach working on their centrepiece of work and

                    teaching and advising interested competitors on how to work with sand.<br>

                    This aspect of the festival can be categorised as a "performance Art", as not only is a sculpture
                    being exhibited, but the public can see how the sculpture is being made whilst also getting involved
                    themselves.</p>

                <p>
                    Doyle and Mulvaney piece was called "Shipwreck" which featured a sailor clinging to a ships mast,
                    hauling another another out of the sea.
                    It measures approx. 6ft in height, with base measurements of 10ft x 15ft</p>

                <p>
                    The "Shipwreck" piece was originally 8ft in height, but had been vandalised on the first night of
                    the festival.
                    This action prompted all future exhibition pieces in subsequent festivals to be enclosed in a
                    tent.

                <p>First place in the Amateur Competition this first year went to Danny Brennan, a local artist, with

                    It featured the head and hand of the god, gasping for air as he rises from the sea.
                    His piece was finished minutes before the deadline, which was when the tide would come in.
                    Brennan had never made a sandsculpture before.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Following the successful first year, Cockleshell Gallery discovered at this time that Ireland was one
                    of the few European countries without a national sandsculpting competition. Encouraged by the first
                    festival's success, they began to pursue the task of organising and hosting an international
                    Competition which
                    would be Ireland's first Open Sand Sculpture Championship, as part of the nationwide Year 2000
                    Millenium
                    Celebration
                    Arts Program.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>The theme for 2000 was "Sea-Tales". The new artists involved were Neils "Edwin" Vegter from Holland,
                    Caroline
                    Saint-Olive from France, Nuria Villaginis from Spain and Sissa Yorgensen from Denmark. Other artists
                    such as
                    Niall Magee and Alan Magee have since joined this group.

                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Gather empty buckets for water and sandpile-building, spray bottle for water,
                    carving tools (be creative - trowels, spades, knives, forks, spoons, pallette knives, twisted wire),
                    shells/driftwood for decoration.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Create a mound of damp sand in roughly the height and width of your proposed sculpture.
                    Constantly pack the sand down to make it denser with each bucket of sand you add to build the pile.

                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Gently remove sand from the pile to get the general shape right. Start with the highest point first
                    and
                    work down, so falling sand only lands on uncarved surfaces. Use bigger tools to rough out the shape,
                    smaller tools for details.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Carve out the focal points first — the bits that tell the story — then go back and add detail to the
                    rest.
                    Once a section is finished, keep misting with water to prevent sand collapsing. Finish with
                    decoration.
