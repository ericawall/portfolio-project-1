                <hr>
                <p>
                    The very first amateur sculpture festival was staged in 1999, and was co-ordinated by Brendan Doyle
                    of the Cockleshell Art Gallery. Brendan had first seen sandsculpture the previous year on holiday in
                    italy, and noticed that the sand used was very similar to the sand on Duncannon Beach.<br>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    The gallery commissioned artists Daniel Doyle and Fergus Mulvaney to come and test the sand for
                    suitability and to act as resident artists for the duration of the festival. Both artists were
                    studying sculpture at D.I.T. at this time, and also members of the Irish Sand & Snow Sculpture
                    collective.

                <p>
                    Doyle and Mulvaney spent four days on the beach working on their centrepiece of work and
                    simultaneously
                    teaching and advising interested competitors on how to work with sand.<br>

                <p>
                    This aspect of the festival can be categorised as a "performance Art", as not only is a sculpture
                    being exhibited, but the public can see how the sculpture is being made whilst also getting involved
                    themselves.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Doyle and Mulvaney piece was called "Shipwreck" which featured a sailor clinging to a ships mast,
                    hauling another another out of the sea.
                    It measures approx. 6ft in height, with base measurements of 10ft x 15ft</p>

                <p>
                    The "Shipwreck" piece was originally 8ft in height, but had been vandalised on the first night of
                    the festival.
                    This action prompted all future exhibition pieces in subsequent festivals to be enclosed in a
                    tent.<br>

                <p>First place in the Amateur Competition this first year went to Danny Brennan, a local artist, with
                    his sculpture of the celtic god of the sea, "Manannan Mac Lir".

                <p>
                    It featured the head and hand of the god, gasping for air as he rises from the sea.
                    His piece was finished minutes before the deadline, which was when the tide would come in.
                    Brennan had never made a sandsculpture before.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Following the successful first year, Cockleshell Gallery discovered at this time that Ireland was one
                    of the few European countries without a national sandsculpting competition.
                    Encouraged by the first festival's success, they began to pursue the task of organising and hosting
                    an international Competition
                    which would be Ireland's first Open Sand Sculpture Championship, as part of the nationwide Year 2000
                    Millenium Celebration Arts Program.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    The theme for 2000 was "Sea-Tales". The new artists involved were Neils "Edwin" Vegter from Holland,
                    Caroline Saint-Olive from France,
                    Nuria Villaginis from Spain and Sissa Yorgensen from Denmark. Other artists such as Niall Magee and
                    Alan Magee have since joined this group.
