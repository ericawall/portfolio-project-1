# Duncannon Sand Sculpture Festival

This is a website for a County Wexford based sand sculpture arts festival. Traditional sand sculptures are sandcastles, but now the art form has elevated into sculptures of virtually anything a person could expect to see already created through stone, metal or wood.

The Duncannon festival has been operating since 1999, with a closure of 2 years due to Covid-19. It will return in 2023, and this new website hopes to inform the public of the dates and schedule of events, to engage potential visitors through images of past gatherings and informational content regarding sand sculptures, and to create a level of anticipation for the upcoming festival. Also, there is a section where interested artists, both professional or amateur, and potential volunteers can register their interest in being involved in a hand-on way.

It is primarily targeted towards families, as there are many child-friendly and teenager-friendly participation events. However it is also targeted at those who are looking for entertainment in the outdoors, and for tourists of all ages to the region.

### Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

#### Unfixed Bugs/Issues
I am unable to get the hero image to reduce for smaller screen sizes.

I wanted to make the video on the Gallery page a larger size on PC screen, and I succeeded, but when I tried to make it suitable for smaller screens parts of the video were being cut off, I reverted back to the current size as I was just unable to figure this out.

The text on the History and How to Sandsculpt sections are giving me difficulty when I reduce size for smaller screens. I cannot get the text to align in the center correctly.

#### Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

### Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
